                      Hello! My name is Abelard Bautista and I am an aspiring
                      Software Developer. I currently work in the field of
                      reproductive genetics as a laboratory supervisor but I am
                      looking into transitioning to a career more focused in
                      tech. As a lifelong learner, I aspire to continue learning
                      about new computer languages and skills that I can use to
                      improve my life and the lives of others. At work, I
                      independently developed a productivity tool using
                      Microsoft Excel for my current company which utilized a
                      variety of macros and nested formulas to dynamically sort
                      and provide information based on a variety of client
                      parameters. This tool was incorporated by upper management
                      as a model for software that all employees in my company
                      would use worldwide. Looking towards the future, I am
                      excited to immerse myself in tech so as to equip myself
                      with the tools to contribute to the development of more of
                      these productivity projects.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Outside of my interest in tech, I have hobbies in beer,
                      music, and plants. For the past two years, I have reviewed
                      over 100+ different beers that I have tried throughout the
                      world. I have also encouraged my friends and family, who
                      also imbibe, to post their own reviews using a Google Form
                      that I created. My current top three favorite beer types
                      are Double IPAs, Hazy IPAs, and Marzens. One day, I aspire
                      to develop an app that can be used for beer reviews and
                      also work on other personal projects for people to enjoy.
